# Scalable Recommendation with Hierarchical Poisson Factorization
Variational Inference for HPF by Gopalan et al. (2013)\
This work was done for the PhD exam of Computational Statistics (Fall 2020)\
The .py file contains the model.\
One notebook contains a basic implementation of the algorithm.\
The Recommendations_with_HPF notebook exploits the module hpf_vi to make use of the algorithm.
